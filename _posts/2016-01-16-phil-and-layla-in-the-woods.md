# Phil and Layla in the woods

So, perhaps, maybe, I'm getting back into photography again. It's a strongly processed photograph with definite artificial depth of field, but somehow it seems to work. It seemed like an oddity to be trying to light a candelabra in the woods. Formal dining in an informal setting, made all the more engaging by the focus required to light the candle and keep alive the flame, both as guardian and observer.

This photograph is in a similar vein. Once I'd claimed to establish a little fondness for some artificial age, I tried to give them a little variation. This one is effectively cast with some warm leaking light on the right hand side. It fitted with the dress as Phil's blue suited him left in cool. Interestingly the corner of the rock provides a nice intersection, between the planes of the subjects and the nature of their poses.

This one is from the gisting earlier and what I described as the want cause for Analogue effects from NIK, now owned by Google. No doubt all those faux FX came from somewhere. I'll upload the more recent one after so you can see the difference. This one does seem really work with the dark vignette, although if it's repeated all the way through a series, it gets a little bit spoiled. Admittedly I prefer it at the bottom of the picture than the top, and would happily dispense with the darkening at the top. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/23d78a4d-d385-475d-839b-e25fe7aedaf6.jpg)

This picture does have a more delicate quality, particularly the skull and the paleness in the skin. I brought the luminosity of the leaves right down also. Right....now for the haunting picture. This one has some mystical mist in it. Pretty much the camera flash sync refused to function after this photo was taken. It added to the spooky feel in the picture.

Right. Thats enough to test. I'm going to hit yo.
